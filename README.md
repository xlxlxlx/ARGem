# About ARGem

ARGem


ARGem is a pipeline specialized for ARG analysis and is completely developed from the initial DNA short reads to the final visualization of results. It was designed for modest numbers of samples processed in one day and for affordable computational components, though the throughput could be easily increased through cloud resources. A key feature of the \pipeline pipeline is the essential use of project metadata provided by project creators to enable analysis of data across samples and projects. 

ARGem was built by research groups from Virginia Tech. This project is funded by USDA, grant number 2017-68003-26498.
